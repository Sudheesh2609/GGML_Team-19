## A project on Inference of Deep Belief Networks
We used two methods for performing reconstruction of MNIST dataset, one using Artificial neural network and other using three hidden layered Deep Belief Network. Using DBN for classification task has shown good performance and reconstruction output is improving upon increasing the number of hidden layers.
